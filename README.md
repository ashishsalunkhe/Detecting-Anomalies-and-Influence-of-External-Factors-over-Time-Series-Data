# Detecting-Anomalies-and-Influence-of-External-Factors-over-Time-Series-Data

Stock Price Forecasting is one of the most important areas in financial domains and time series forecasting is analogous to it. Stock Markets are highly volatile and several factors are responsible for prices to change over a period of time. This work aims at understanding the correlation between Google Trends and Stock Prices. We aim to emphasize how search trends related to a particular organization can be used as one of the aspects in peripheral data in understanding and finding its relationship with the stock price. While doing that, various anomaly detection techniques over time series data are used in understanding their significance in finding different types of anomalies. We try to compare statistical techniques with machine learning models such as DBSCAN, Isolation forest, and PyCaretâ€™s Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Module and draw observations explaining their importance in point and group anomalies.
We are using Python as the programming language and different Python packages. Some of the main packages used - pytrends (for Google Trends data), yfinance (for Stock Price data), statsmodels (for statistical models).
